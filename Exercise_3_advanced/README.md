# Assignment 3 (Advanced) ‚Äì Predicting Dow Jones Index from News Headlines

This notebook explores whether it's possible to predict movements of the **Dow Jones Industrial Average** (DJIA) based on the **top 25 news headlines** from each day between 2008 and 2016. The project combines natural language processing (NLP) with machine learning to simulate a financial prediction pipeline.

## üìä Datasets Used

1. **News_Data_1**  
   - Daily top 25 news headlines (2008‚Äì2016)  
   - Contains a `Label` column indicating market movement:  
     - `1` ‚Üí Positive movement  
     - `0` ‚Üí Negative movement  
   - Used for training machine learning models.

2. **Stock_Data**  
   - Contains daily DJIA closing prices.  
   - Used for simulating trading decisions based on predictions.

3. **News_Data_2**  
   - Additional news data for testing the trained models.  
   - Enables evaluating performance on unseen data.

## üìå Contents

- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, removing punctuation, combining news headlines)  
- Feature extraction using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF  
- Training and evaluation of multiple classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Naive Bayes  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
