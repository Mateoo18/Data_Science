    "So, we are going to predict the weight change based on the daily routines of people. Here we have what each column represent:\n",
    "1. Participant ID: Unique identifier for each participant in the study.\n",
    "2. Age: The age of the participant (in years), which can influence metabolism and weight change.\n",
    "3. Gender: Gender of the participant (M/F), as physiological differences may affect weight management.\n",
    "4. Current Weight (lbs): The participant's weight at the beginning of the study, serving as a baseline for weight change.\n",
    "5. BMR (Calories): Basal Metabolic Rate, calculated using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, representing the number of calories burned at rest.\n",
    "6. Daily Calories Consumed: Total caloric intake per day, including variability to reflect real-world eating habits.\n",
    "7. Daily Caloric Surplus/Deficit: The difference between calories consumed and BMR, indicating whether the participant is in a caloric surplus or deficit.\n",
    "8. Weight Change (lbs): The estimated change in weight over a specified duration, based on caloric surplus/deficit.\n",
    "9. Duration (weeks): The time period over which weight change is measured, ranging from 1 to 12 weeks.\n",
    "9. Physical Activity Level: Self-reported level of physical activity, categorized as Sedentary, Lightly Active, Moderately Active, or Very Active.\n",
    "10. Macronutrient Breakdown: Composition of the participant's diet, expressed as percentages of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.\n",
    "11. Sleep Quality: Self-reported quality of sleep, categorized as Poor, Fair, Good, or Excellent, which can affect weight management.\n",
    "12. Stress Level: A numerical score (1-10) indicating the participant's perceived stress level, as stress can influence eating behaviors and weight."
