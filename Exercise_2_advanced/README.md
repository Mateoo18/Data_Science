# Assignment 2 (Advanced) – Advanced Regression and Model Tuning

This notebook presents an advanced approach to a regression task, expanding on standard preprocessing by incorporating feature engineering and multiple regression models. It also includes model evaluation and comparison to identify the most effective solution.

## 📌 Contents

- Advanced preprocessing with `ColumnTransformer`
- Feature scaling and encoding
- Regularized regression models: Ridge and Lasso
- Ensemble model: Random Forest Regressor
- Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R²
- Comparison of model performance

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Standardization of numerical features
- Regularization with Ridge and Lasso
- Ensemble learning (Random Forest)
- Performance benchmarking across models

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
