- Outlier detection using IQR method
- Categorical variable analysis (value counts, bar plots)
- Summary statistics and data quality insights

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Missing data heatmaps and barplots
- Pearson correlation analysis
- Outlier detection with IQR
- Data visualization for numerical and categorical features
- Grouped aggregation and comparison across features
