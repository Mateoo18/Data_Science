# 🧠 Data Science – Assignments & Projects by Mateusz Nowak

Welcome to my collection of data science assignments completed as part of an academic and practical learning journey. The repository includes hands-on projects covering topics like data preprocessing, regression, text classification, clustering, statistical inference, and more.

Each assignment is structured as a Jupyter Notebook with clear explanations, Python code, and commentary. Both introductory and advanced versions are included to reflect different levels of depth.
