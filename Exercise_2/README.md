# Assignment 2 – Regression Modeling

This notebook contains solutions for a regression task as part of a data science assignment. The main objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts a continuous target variable based on a mix of numerical and categorical features.

## 📌 Contents

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Train-test split
- Regression modeling using Linear Regression
- Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R²

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- One-hot encoding of categorical features
- Standardization of numerical features
- Pipeline creation with `ColumnTransformer`
- Linear Regression using scikit-learn
- Model performance analysis

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
